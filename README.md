js1# is a browser-based implementation of the 1# text register machine used in Larry Moss's recursion theory classes: http://www.indiana.edu/~iulg/trm/ .

The 1# interpreter is written in Javascript and jQuery and runs locally in the browser. The web interface is in Bootstrap. js1# could be packaged with these libraries and run without a web server or internet connection.
