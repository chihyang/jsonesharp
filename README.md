js1# is a browser-based implementation of the 1# text register machine used in Larry Moss's recursion theory classes: http://www.indiana.edu/~iulg/trm/

The 1# interpreter is written in Javascript and jQuery and runs locally in the browser. The web interface is in Bootstrap. js1# could be packaged with these libraries and run without a web server or internet connection.

This is the currently the result of an evening of hacking by someone who is not at all a web programmer. The goal was simply to build an accessible and easy-to-use tool for students working on the exercises in the course that involve writing 1# programs.

I invite other students to improve this thing. Even if you're not inclined to work on the coding, please feel free to write about bugs or areas for improvement in the issue tracker: https://github.com/rrose1/jsonesharp/issues
